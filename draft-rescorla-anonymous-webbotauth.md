--- abstract

Automated agents ("bots") represent a large fraction of the traffic
to many Web sites. In some cases, this traffic is desired, in others
undesired, and in yet others, desired as long as it remains within
certain rate limits. This memo describes an overall architecture
for authorizing bot traffic while protecting anonymous access.

# Introduction

Automated agents ("bots") represent a large fraction of the traffic
to many Web sites. For example, Wikimedia reports that about 35% of
its traffic is from bots {{PCMag-Wikipedia}} and Cloudflare reports
that over 50% of traffic is automated {{Cloudflare-2025}}. High
traffic loads--even when from otherwise desired bots--can have
negative impacts on sites in terms of performance, stability,
and operational costs.

In addition, there may be certain types of bot traffic that sites which
to heavily restrict or block entirely. For example:

- Volumetric traffic intended to create a DoS
  attack on the site.
- Non-volumetric traffic intended to attack the site.
- Scraping for specific purposes such as training AI agents.

{{?I-D.nottingham-webbotauth-use-cases}} provides a more complete
list of potential use cases.

The obvious way to address undesired bot traffic is to require
bots to authenticate to the server. The overall idea here is
that sites can use behavioral analysis to determine when traffic
from a given endpoint appears bot-like (e.g., is high volume,
has low latency between requests, appears to be retrieving the
entire site, etc.) and restrict access by those endpoints unless
they authenticate and the resulting identity is acceptable to
the site. {{?I-D.meunier-webbotauth-registry}} describes
one such architecture, where identities are rooted in the
DNS and bots use digital signatures to tie their activitity
to a given identity.

While directly identifying each bot allows the site to precisely
monitor bots behavior and restrict or block bots that it believes
are misbehaving, it also has potential negative effects on the
open Web, including:

- Allowing sites to precisely discriminate against specific
  bots, even when those bots are acting in the public interest.
  For example:
  * Government sites might block bots which are tracking
    law enforcement activity.
  * Employment or housing sites might block bots which are
    monitoring for discriminatory behavior.
  * Shopping sites might block bots used for price comparison.

- Preventing users and groups from being able to anonymously
  retrieve Web content using automated tools.

This document describes an alternative architecture that allows
for anonymous authorization and rate limiting of bots while
avoiding directly identifying individual bots, thus making it
more difficult for sites to precisely select the list of acceptable
bots.
